# Project: Musical Butterfly

# ID: 23001
---
Theme for this circuit building project is a butterfly that has many LEDs as well as sound. It is an easy one to build and you could potentially use it to decorate your room, desktop or even give it as a gift to put a smile on someone's face !

You can easily get all the parts at a reasonable price (i.e., $9.99 at the time of writing). **[Follow this link][1]** if you would like to get and build one for yourself. It is a fun and simple project. I promise :)


Project Challenges
---
I cannot think of any major challenges here except the instruction manual, which is in Chinese and I do not speak it unfortunately. Instructions come in two pages. On the first page there is the circuit diagram and that was not hard to follow (with only the title in Chinese). The second page has important details such as power supply voltage, how to use the remote control, and how to switch between different modes of operation for improved user experience.

In order to make life easier for the readers, I got the two instruction pages translated, which you can access using the following links:

**[1 - Instructions in English for page 1][2]**

**[2 - Instructions in English for page 2][3]**

There may be readers who would also like the original instructions in Chinese. Therefore, you can use the following links to access them:

**[1 - Original instructions on Page 1 in Chinese][4]**

**[2 - Original instructions on Page 2 in Chinese][5]**
